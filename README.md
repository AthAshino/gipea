# gipea

A very simple API client for Gitea > 1.16.1

Note that not the full Swagger-API is accessible. The whole implementation is focused
on making access and working with Organizations, Teams, Repositories and Users as pain
free as possible.

Originally forked from https://github.com/Langenfeld/py-gitea.

## Usage

First get a `gitea` object wrapping access and authentication (via an api token) for your gitea instance:

```python
from gipea import *

gitea = Gitea(URL, TOKEN)
```

Operations like requesting the Gitea version or authentication user can be requested directly from the `gitea` object:

```python
print("Gitea Version: " + gitea.get_version())
print("API-Token belongs to user: " + gitea.get_user().username)
```

Adding entities like Users, Organizations, ... also is done via the gitea object.

```python
user = gitea.create_user("Test Testson", "test@test.test", "password")
```

All operations on entities in gitea are then accomplished via the according wrapper objects for those entities.
Each of those objects has a `.request` method that creates an entity according to your gitea instance.

```python
other_user = User.request(gitea, "OtherUserName")
print(other_user.username)
```

Note that the fields of the User, Organization,... classes are dynamically created at runtime, and thus not visible
during divelopment. Refer to the Gitea-API documentation for the fields names.

Fields that can not be altered via gitea-api, are read only. After altering a field, the `.commit` method of the
according object must be called to synchronize the changed fields with your gitea instance.

```python
org = Organization.request(gitea, test_org)
org.description = "some new description"
org.location = "some new location"
org.commit()
```

An entity in gitea can be deleted by calling delete.

```python
org.delete()
```

All entity objects do have methods to execute some of the requests possible though the gitea-api:

```python
org = Organization.request(gitea, ORGNAME)
teams = org.get_teams()
for team in teams:
    repos = team.get_repos()
    for repo in repos:
        print(repo.name)
```

## Installation

Use ``pip install gipea`` to install.

## Tests

Tests can be run with:

```make test```

The default server credentials that will be used are:
url = `http://localhost:3000` and admin-user token located in `.token`.

These parameters can be overwritten with the env variables:
GIPEA_URL
GIPEA_TOKEN

The admin user must be named ``test``, with email ``secondarytest@test.org``.
